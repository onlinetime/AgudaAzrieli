## Components

### `app/App.js`
This file is the main entry point of the application. It initializes the app and sets up navigation or routing if applicable.

### `app/modal.tsx`
Defines a modal screen component that displays some information and includes a status bar configuration for iOS.

### `components/Login.jsx`
Contains the `Login` component, which allows users to log in using their email and password. It includes state management for email, password, and messages, as well as functions for handling login and password reset.

### `components/EditScreenInfo.jsx`
This component likely displays information about the current screen or app state.

### `firebase.js`
Initializes Firebase with the provided configuration and exports the Firestore and Auth instances for use throughout the application.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Configure Firebase by replacing the configuration in `firebase.js` with your own Firebase project credentials.
5. Run the application using `npm start` or `expo start`.

## Usage

To add the `Login` component to your application, follow these steps:

1. Import the `Login` component in `app/App.js` or wherever you want to use it:
   ```javascript
   import Login from '../components/Login';
   ```

2. Include the `Login` component in the render method or return statement of your main component:
   ```javascript
   function App() {
     return (
       <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
         <Login />
       </View>
     );
   }
   ```

3. Ensure that any necessary navigation or state management is set up to handle the login flow.

Make sure to adjust any styles or layout as needed to fit your app's design.
